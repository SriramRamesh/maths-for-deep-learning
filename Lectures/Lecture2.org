#+TITLE: Lecture 2 

* Logistics: Final Project
    - Group of 2-4 ppl
    - Not a research project
    - Review on March (1 page abstract document)
    - Similar to ML blog post
    
* Recall
- Main Goal -> Find *Good* functional spaces
    \( \gamma(f) is small for f we care about\)
- f: X -> R with X as high dimensional space
- In most applications , we can use physical domain to higher
  - ex1: X = { x: \(  \) image - > R^3 (RGB)
  - Ex2: Time series
    X={ x: R->R} ;; Financial time series, speech/music
  - Ex: Solar system

    X = {x:G -> R^k}
    G - graph (V,E)
    Usages in 
    + Particle systems
    + Social n/w
    + financial n/w
    + chemistry
- In all these examples the high dimensional observations are hiding an underlying "low-dimensional" structure arising from
  the physical world
  + Q: How to leverage such structure to build models?
   we will be refering to physics

   Symmetry

   A symmetry of F is an invertible transformation

   T: X -> X such that \( \forall f \in F \forall x \in X \)
   \[ f(Tx) = f(x) \]

   Issue: symmetries of X(high dimensions) are hard to describe
